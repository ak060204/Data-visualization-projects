# Project Overview
### What I’m Doing: 
Creating an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze a dataset of bike buyers. <a href = ""> view Dashboard </a>

### Project Objective: 
Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing customer data to provide insights on purchase behavior, income levels, commute distance, and age group.

### Questions I'm Trying to Solve: 
o	Does income correlate with the likelihood of purchasing a bike?

o	How does commute distance affect buying decisions?

o	What are the trends in different age groups for bike purchases?

# Dataset
### Columns Used: 
o	ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars Owned, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike.

# Features & Analysis
### Data Cleaning: 
Removed duplicates and fixed common data entry errors.
### Pivot Tables: 
Used to summarize age groups, income levels, and bike purchase rates.
### Age Grouping: 
Categorized customers into groups like 'Adolescent' (0-30), 'Middle Aged' (31-54), 'Old' (55+).
### Interactive Dashboard: 
Created slicers for filtering data by age, marital status, income, and bike purchase status.

# Data Visualization Focus
•	Focused on refining the process of visualizing data using pivot tables and charts.

# Initial Chart Creation
•	Added a chart to represent data and adjusted number formatting to remove decimals and add commas for clarity.

•	Used a 3D chart to split data by gender and income levels, showing purchase behavior.

•	Added axis titles and a meaningful chart title: 'Average Income per Purchase.'

•	Kept the chart simple by avoiding data labels.

# Commute Distances and Bike Purchases Visualization
•	Focused on commute distances and bike purchases.

•	Fixed an issue with the 10-mile data by renaming it ‘10+ miles’ for clarity.

•	Created a chart titled 'Customer Commute' to show how commute distances affect purchase decisions.

# Age Brackets Visualization
•	Grouped age data into 'Adolescent,' 'Middle Aged,' and 'Old' categories.

•	Decided to keep the original age ranges in the pivot table due to data order issues.

•	Created a line chart titled 'Customer Age Brackets,' revealing trends, especially in the 30-54 age range for bike purchases.
# Dashboard Creation
•	Copied visualizations to a new sheet for dashboard creation.

•	Adjusted size and layout for a clean, organized look.

•	Removed gridlines for a clearer presentation.

•	Finalized the dashboard to visually represent key insights.

# Final Thoughts
•	Still refining the process but confident the approach will be valuable for future projects.

•	The visualizations answer key questions like the correlation between income and purchase likelihood, and how commute distance influences buying decisions.
